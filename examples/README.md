# examples

To work on examples projects with a clean muse environments (without core plugins), you need to set the Muse config file to an empty one.

For example:

```bash
export MUSE_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=./muse.config.js
```

Run the command under `./examples` folder then do all Muse operations with Muse CLI, or just start the Muse manager by:

```bash
muse manager
```
